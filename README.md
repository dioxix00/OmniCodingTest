# OmniCodingTest
A coding test using Django to create a simple movie listing website

## Extra Notes
In management/commands I have populate_movies.py, it's used to populate the database automatically rather than typing it one-by-one through admin console, using this command below

```bash
python manage.py populate_movies "DIRECTORY OF JSON"
```
